Hi there!

I specialize in graphics programming and GPU performance. My work shipped in several AAA games to millions of players across the globe - here is where you can find my open-source contributions.

### Main project (ON HOLD)

[reaper](https://github.com/Ryp/reaper) is the small engine I'm crafting as the basis for codename **Neptune** - a game I'm working on. It features:
* Windows and Linux support
* Custom-made renderer built on Vulkan
* Framegraph-based render pass declaration with automatic resource allocation and barrier placement
* Efficient visibility rendering with meshlet rendering as a first class citizen
* PBR lighting with an end-to-end HDR pipeline
* ...and many more!
